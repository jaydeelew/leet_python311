# 0. Double Base Paliindromes
# The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001â‚‚ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.
# Hence, we call 585 a double base palindrome number.
# Write a program to find the sum of all double base palindrome numbers
# which are less than a given number (starting from 1, including the given number).
# As an example, if the given number is 5, the double base palindromes less than or equal to 5
# are 1 (binary 1), 3 (binary 11), and 5 (binary 101). The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
# Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.
