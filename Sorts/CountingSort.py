# Time Complexity: O(N+M), where N and M are the size of inputArray[] and countArray[] respectively.
# Space Complexity: O(N+M), where N and M are the space taken by outputArray[] and countArray[] respectively.

# Advantage of Counting Sort:
# Counting sort generally performs faster than all comparison-based sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and quicksort, if the range of input is of the order of the number of input.
# Counting sort is easy to code
# Counting sort is a stable algorithm.

# Disadvantage of Counting Sort:
# Counting sort doesnâ€™t work on decimal values.
# Counting sort is inefficient if the range of values to be sorted is very large.
# Counting sort is not an In-place sorting algorithm, It uses extra space for sorting the array elements.
