# 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck
# You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck.
# You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
# - numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
# - numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
# You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck.
# You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
# Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
